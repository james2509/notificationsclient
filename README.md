## Notifications Basic Client (React)
The Notifications microservice manages user notifications. It responds to system wide events and depending on the type of event it will generate a new user notification and store it in its store.

When a user logs in, the user will fetch all of their notifications. A socket is opened between the notifications service and the userâ€™s browser, which allows the notifications service to push new notifications to a user during their session.

## Setup
The Notifications Basic Client was built with VS Code and boostrapped with Create React App. 

If the Notifications Micro service project is running in debug from Visual Studio using the settings stored in the project folder it will be running on URL http://localhost:50506. If this has been changed or deployed then the URL for the socket connection will need to be changed in Components/NotificationsPage.js before running the client.
